am required to print the nodes on a single level of a binary see how this can be done but then again I not very skilled with algorithms in know that in traversal you use a queue and that you start by putting the root node in the queue then you dequeue it visit it and enqueue children and then you dequeue the first enqued child visit it and enqueue children and so by my understanding this makes it impossible to know exactly when one level ends and another begins unless you assign each node level when the binary tree is created and then just check the level when you are doing the like code is in PHP but this is not a PHP related question it is a general algorithm related question this is part of a function that adds a node to a binary tree storing the level in the node when each node is while else else my question this the only way of printing the nodes on a single level of a binary there another there another way without storing the level when creating the you in print all the elements on a single given level of a binary

indeed work and I think it ever but not because no way to get allow you to use SQL and provides a lot of different options for mapping the results into your entities java You could write your query FROM JOIN on WHERE execute it from Hibernate objectAs problem with SQL and HQL is that very easy to get into a conflict between them SQL generated from HQL may use one table raw SQL generated SQL may contain tables joins conflicting with raw it the all that gets you absolutely it even help your use If you want someone to modify a HQL SQL query they still need to know SQL and HQL at least at the level necessary to distinguish between the that if your end user needs to be able to customize that perhaps you should be looking at using in order to generate the query you need based on Having end user modify an actual query within the application is a gaping security hole unless you take
relationships really make sense if into normalization as anything that would be would be kept in the same the real world often You may want to break your data up to match your applications

from a base class to a derived class is a bad code smell in most through the use of virtual is a better calling code should invoke a method using the base class allowing it to be dispatched to the appropriate implementation in the derived know this is a fairly generic but without some code snippets as examples difficult to recommend a more specific answer in your

a good idea to make a class immutable for performance reasons Take for When you call this static method it does not have to return a new Integer It can return a previously created instance safe in the knowledge that when it passed you a reference to that instance last time you modify it guess this is also good reasoning from a security reason perspective agree with the standpoint taken in Effective Java on these matters you should either design your classes for extensibility or make them If its your intention to make something extensible perhaps consider an interface or abstract you have to make the class You can make the constructors
